# Week 04 - Challenge Design
In today's class, you'll be moving beyond the lens of the toy and begining to design some of the challenges in for your final level.

## Tools used
Today's task uses (but is not limited to):
* Github Desktop (or your Github client of choice)
* Unity
* Prototyping tools of your choice.

## Assignment deliverable
Today, you should be working towards creating challenge prototypes for your level design task. Once again, you will be working in your assignment repo today, so make sure you are pushing things into that repo.

## "I bet you can't..." (10 min)
Return to your toy from last week, including your notes. Consider which objects you most gravitated towards and found produced the most interesting dynamics. Then, consider how you could complete the sentence "I bet you can't..." with those objects in mind. For instance (these examples are NOT using objects in this game):

* "I bet you can't get from this door to that door without one of the guards seeing you" (Stealth games)
* "I bet you can't survive for 5 minutes against the zombies" (Shooters, action games)
* "I bet you can't get to the top of the tower before the lava reaches you." (Platformers)

This call to action for your player is going to inform how you develop your challenges today. While your final level with have many different challenges through its different encounters, today's class will help you form the core idea of what kinds of challenge we are always coming back to.

So, consider: what kind of challenge are you really going for here? Is it a physical challenge? An intellectual challenge? Maybe something in between?

Write down both your "I bet you can't..." statement and the type of challenge you are going for. This is now a core design goal for your level. It may change after today, but this is how we get started!

## Core skill (20 min)
Create a new Test scene in your repo (you can do this from the Kit Tools drop-down, or by duplicating an existing scene and then renaming and editing it).

With reference to the lectures, think about what the core skill is here. That is, what is it you are really testing the player on: is it about the precision of their aiming? Is it about patern recognition of moving platforms? Prototype (pen and paper, then in engine) a small section of gameplay that tests only this core skill. For instance, if you are focused on precision of the player shooting a switch, then that aiming and firing is the core skill - don't introduce enemies or other objects that would require the player to focus on other skills at this stage.

Don't make this particular challenge too difficult. It shouldn't be trivial, but we are only just getting started...

## Something trickier... (15 min)
Create another section immediately after your first that engages with the same core skill, but is more difficult for the player to achieve. As much as you can, avoid introducing other elements at this stage. Returning to the question of precision, what about a smaller switch? Or a more narrow window to hit it in? Once again, prototype this section, and make sure you are capturing your artefacts as you go and placing them in your repo.

## Stressors and tertiary challenges (15 min)


## More challenges and dramatic arc

### Reflect
Include a section on reflection to ensure students are doing something with their knowledge in the moment.

## Next Week
Next week we'll be looking at how we can situate our challenges as parts of a broader level, complete with connective tissue.
