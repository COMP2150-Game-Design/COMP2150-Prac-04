# Week 04 - Challenge Design
In today's class, you'll be moving beyond the lens of the toy and begining to design some of the challenges in for your final level.

## Tools used
Today's task uses (but is not limited to):
* Github Desktop (or your Github client of choice)
* Unity
* Prototyping tools of your choice.

## Assignment deliverable
Today, you should be working towards creating challenge prototypes for your level design task. Once again, you will be working in your assignment repo today, so make sure you are pushing things into that repo.

## "I bet you can't..." (10 min)
Return to your toy from last week, including your notes. Consider which objects you most gravitated towards and found produced the most interesting dynamics. Then, consider how you could complete the sentence "I bet you can't..." with those objects in mind. For instance (these examples are NOT using objects in this game):

* "I bet you can't get from this door to that door without one of the guards seeing you" (Stealth games)
* "I bet you can't survive for 5 minutes against the zombies" (Shooters, action games)
* "I bet you can't get to the top of the tower before the lava reaches you." (Platformers)

This call to action for your player is going to inform how you develop your challenges today. While your final level with have many different challenges through its different encounters, today's class will help you form the core idea of what kinds of challenge we are always coming back to.

So, consider: what kind of challenge are you really going for here? Is it a physical challenge? An intellectual challenge? Maybe something in between?

Write down both your "I bet you can't..." statement and the type of challenge you are going for. This is now a core design goal for your level. It may change after today, but this is how we get started!

## Challenge 1: Core skill (20 min)
Create a new Test scene in your repo (you can do this from the Kit Tools drop-down, or by duplicating an existing scene and then renaming and editing it).

With reference to the lectures, think about what the core skill is here. That is, what is it you are really testing the player on: is it about the precision of their aiming? Is it about patern recognition of moving platforms? Prototype (pen and paper, then in engine) a small section of gameplay that tests only this core skill. For instance, if you are focused on precision of the player shooting a switch, then that aiming and firing is the core skill - don't introduce enemies or other objects that would require the player to focus on other skills at this stage.

Don't make this particular challenge too difficult. However, the player should be able to "fail", either through death and restarting the level, or simply having to go back to the start and try again.

## Challenge 2: Something trickier... (15 min)
Create another section immediately after your first that engages with the same core skill, but is more difficult for the player to achieve. As much as you can, avoid introducing other elements at this stage. Returning to the question of precision, what about a smaller switch? Or a more narrow window to hit it in? What if the switch was further way? Think about how this makes things trickier for the player by engaging with their core skill (e.g., a switch further away changes how many positions you can hit it from). Once again, prototype this section, and make sure you are capturing your artefacts as you go and placing them in your repo.

## Challenge 3: Stressors and tertiary challenges (15 min)
Create a third section following on from Challenge 2. Now that you have an understanding of the core skill you are engaging with and how to increase difficulty through it, we can consider what stressors may be added to introduce tertiary challenges and give more variance to the challenge. Going back over your notes from last week, think about some of the other objects you aren't currently using and the types of challenges they provide. Some example questions:

* How might environmetal effects like moving platforms or hazards make this more challenging, dramatic or interesting for the player?
* Is there another category of challenge (physical, intellectual, etc...) that could compliment what is going on here? How so, and what objects could be used to achieve it?
* Is there something else I could be getting the player to do at the same time? Are there elements of the Ellen toy they aren't yet engaging with?

A couple of notes:
* Although in this context these are "stressors" and "tertirary challenges", that doesn't mean they can't be core challenges in and of themselves. For instance, a party-based action RPG might have two core challenges of combat and social interaction, but at times the player will need to both at the same time. Indeed, this might be core to your player experience!
* Regardless of if you are grappling with another core skill in your game here or indeed just adding small stressors to your one challenge, anything you add here still brings its own design considerations and will have meaningful impact on the player experience. Make sure you are complimenting the player experience, not creating discordance.


## "Well, can you?" - Time to play each other's games! (20 min)
As our other weeks, spend some time playing each other's games. Tell your player your "I bet you can't..." statement and observe them playing through your three challenges, taking note of what they find difficult and what they breeze through. Try to get a read for whether they are approaching flow: is the first challenge too hard and frustrating? Is the second too easy and boring? Does the third challenge ramp up the intensity and drama, or does it cause your player to disengage? Why?

## More challenges and dramatic arc (Until end)
At this stage you have:
* Identified the main type of challenge you want to engage with in your level.
* Identified at least one of the core skills the player will need to engage with when playing your level.
* Created three challenges that form a small dramatic arc with increases in difficult both via the core skill and additional stresors.
* Have had someone else play the game and have an idea as to how your design is working.

Reflecting on all of this, start prototyping some more challenges that engage with the same skills as before. Consider what other objects can be used as stressors and how. Try prototyping a few of these, and assign each of them a score from 1 to 10 in terms of experiential intensity (as described in the lecture). How might you structure these challenges in sequence to have modulating intensity? Depending on how much time you have, you might want to revise some of your initial challenges.

## Next Week
Next week we'll be looking at how we can situate our challenges as parts of a broader level, and connect them together to form a cohesive level.
